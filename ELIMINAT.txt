A singly linked list is used for this game.
A next pointer variable is taken for keeping track of next kid.

Now to play this game in proper manner i have used ' add() ' and ' eliminate() ' functins.

add() :		=> This is basically used to enter kids in the linked list in proper order.
		=> 'First' node keeps tack of starting kid in the game.

eliminate() :	=> To use this function , you must have to enter a random number N which is between 1 to (total number of kids)-1.
		=> It starts from first kid to N kid and eliminate that kid and then continue it from N+1 kid.
		=> Elimination continues till only one child remains.

Hence the last kid will become winner.
